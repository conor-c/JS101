## Topics

#### Declarations, initialization, assignment, and re-assignment
  * Declarations are the act of creating a variable name without assigning it a value.
  * Initialization is the act of declaring and assigning a variable a value upon creation.
  * Assignment is the act of attaching either a primitive data type to a variable by value, or a pointer to a memory location that holds an object, by reference.
  * Re-assignment is the act of removing all previous values or pointers of a variable, and assigning it new data.
  * LEARN DIFFERENCES BETWEEN VAR / LET, SPECIFICALLY ABOUT VAR'S HOISTING AS UNDEFINED
  * While variables declared with var keyword are hoisted (initialized with undefined before the code is run) which means they are accessible in their enclosing scope even before they are declared
  * [hoisting](https://dev.to/godcrampy/the-secret-of-hoisting-in-javascript-egi)
  ```javascript
a = 10;

console.log(a);
// Reference Error

let a = 5; 
```
  * var and let and const are all hoisted, but let and const go into a temporal deadzone, where they are declared, but not initialized. var gets hoisted AND initialized with undefined
  
#### Variable scope, especially how variables interact with function definitions and blocks
  * Variables declared with 'let' or 'const' have block scope. They can be accessed by all further nested inner blocks, but cannot be accessed by any outer block. A function definition (sometimes also called a function declaration or function statement) are followed by the function body which is denoted by curly braces ({ }) any variable declared within a function body, will only be accessible while the function is running. However, a variable can be declared outside of the function body in an outer scope, as all variables declared in an outer scope, will be accessible by inner scopes.
  
#### Primitive values, objects, and type coercions
  * Primitive values (also called primitive data type) is data that is not an object, and has no methods. They are immutable, and are passed by value. They are as follows:
    * [undefined](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/undefined)
      * Assigned to variables that have have just/only been declared.
      * Returned from methods/functions as an implicit return.
      * Typically occurs implicitly, if you wish to set the absence of a value, you would set the variable to null.
    * [Boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Boolean)
      * Either True, or False. Not to be confused with a _truthy value_ or a _falsy value_.
    * Number
      * 0-9, not to be confused with '0-9'.
    * String
      * 'What you are reading'.
    * BigInt
      * Don't need to worry about this at the moment
    * Symbol
      * Don't need to worry about this at the moment
    * [null](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Null)
      * A null value represents represents a reference that is pointing to the absence/non-existence of something. Similar to undefined.
        * Note that typeof null === 'object' // true (Don't need to worry about why)
      * Usually used to mark the intentional absence of a value for a variable assignment, or return value.
  
  * [Objects](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Working_with_Objects)
    * All arrays are Objects.
    * Objects are a collection of key value pairs. The key is similar to 0-indexed arrays, but instead of using numbers to access specific elements, you use the string that the key assigned as. Values can be any data type, including other objects, arrays, functions, primitive values.
    * An objects key-value pair, is also called a property of that object. If the value of the key-value pair is a function, that property is referred to as a Method.
    * Properties are essentially variables that are associated with that specific object.

  * [Type Coercion](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Type_coercion)

    * Type Coercion can happen both implicitly, and explicitly. It is the act of changing a values data type, into a different data type. For example, 1, is a number, '1' is a string.
    * There are various ways that Type Coercion can occur in JavaScript implicitly such as on operands being acted upon by an operator.
    * It is generally considered best practice to avoid implicit type coercion.
  
#### Object properties
  * Object properties, also referred to as key-value pairs, are the data that makes up an object.
  * Keys, also can be called property names
  * Values, also can be called property values
  * Property values can include any data type, including other objects. 
  * If a property value is a function, that property is considered a method.
  
#### Mutability vs. immutability vs. const (LOOK INTO)
  * Mutability refers to the availability of a variables value to be changed. Primitive values are never mutable. Only Objects/Arrays can be mutable.
  * Immutability refers to the lack of availability of a variables value to be changed. Primitive values are always immutable.
  * When a variable is declared through const (instead of let/var) the variable identifier cannot be reassigned later, this _doesn't_ mean that the contents are immutable, it simply means that the identifier variable that was declared with const cannot reused or reassigned.
    * NOTE: when declaring with const, the variable must be initialized with a value.
  
#### Loose and strict equality
  * Loose equality generally refers to the equality operator (==, !=), this operator will attempt to do implicit type coercion on it's operands when they are of a different type, before comparing the resulting values.
  * Strict equality generally refers to the strict equality operator (===, !==) that will not do any implicit type coercion to attempt to evaluate the operands. It is generally considered best practice to use the strict equality operator, and do Explicit Type Coercion on the operands. This allows the developer to avoid unforeseen bugs that can arise with implicit type coercion, as well as makes the intention of the comparison more clear.
  
#### Passing arguments into and return values out of functions
  * Arguments are passed in where previous parameter variables have been established.
  * Both primitive data types, and Objects/arrays may be passed into a function as an argument. As well as other functions. 
  * When passing in variable identifiers that point to a memory location of an object or array, it's important to note that any direct modification of that argument, will mutate the original object/array. 
    * Variable identifiers that point to a primitive data type, such as a number, are passed into functions as values, and any change to the value of that argument, will not be reflecting by the original argument outside of the functions scope.
  * Functions can return any data type, including other functions. If a return value is not explicitly stated, the function will return undefined, regardless of if your code is made to utilize that return value.
  
#### Working with Strings
  * Strings are a primitive data type and cannot be mutated.
    * Note: While the string itself cannot be mutated, the variable who's value is the string, can be reassigned.
  *  Strings can be thought of as a collection of characters, in the sense that every string is 0-based indexed, and can be accessed using bracket notation similarly to an array.
  * The primitive data type, string in JS belongs to the String Object, as such, strings contain a built in property of .length, and have various included methods that can be used to act upon strings.
  * [String Methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)
  
#### Working with Arrays, especially the iteration methods (forEach, map, filter, and find)
  * Arrays are a collection of elements(values) that can be any data type, including other arrays and objects.
  * Arrays are Zero-Based indexed, and its elements can be accessed various ways, the most basic of which, would be bracket notation.
    * Note: Arrays can only use integers to set and access elements. If strings are used during bracket/dot notation, it is properties that are being created/accessed.
  *  Similar to strings, arrays also have a .length property
     *  Note: Arrays can be _sparse_, their length does not necessarily relate to the number of _defined_ elements in the array.
  *  Arrays belong to the Array class Object, and as such, have various built in methods.
     *  [Methods of Arrays](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array)
        *  .forEach(callback(currentValue[, index[, array]])
           *  Takes a callback function that may utilize above parameters. It is similar to a for loop, in that the callback function will run once for each element in the array. 
           *  The method will always return undefined. 
           *  The method does NOT mutate the array upon which it is called, but the callback function may possibly mutate the calling array.
           *  There is NO WAY to break out of a .forEach loop except by throwing an exception. Therefore it is not recommended if you need to stop it early.
        *  .map(callback(currentValue[, index[, array]])
           *  Takes a callback function, the return value of which is a new array. 
              *  The contents of that array, are the return values of the callback function.
              *  This method does not mutate the array on which it is called, though the callback function could.
              *  The array returned will be the result of each instance of the callback functions return value, if for whatever reason a return value is not specified or results in undefined, .map is perfectly fine returning undefined, resulting in an array who's element is undefined.
        *  .filter(callback(currentValue[, index[, array]])
           *  Takes a callback function and returns a new array.
              *  The elements of that array are all elements of the initial array where the callback function returned true, or a value that coerces to true.
              *  Can be thought of as returning a new array, where each element passed the callback functions test.
              *  If no elements pass the test, an empty array is returned.
              *  Does not mutate the array.
        *  .find(callback(element[, index[, array]])[, thisArg])
           *  Returns the value of the first element in the array that returns a truthy/true value from the callback function. 
           *  If no elements in the array satisfy the provided callback function, .find() will return undefined.
           *  .find does not mutate the array, but the callback function may.
  *  In general, be very aware of any return value a built in method will return, as well as if the method will mutate the original array or not.


#### Working with objects; accessing keys and values of an Object as arrays
  * Objects can be accessed using their key/property name. If the value of that key/property name is an array, the array must be further accessed using bracket notation.
  * Objects have various built in methods that can be used to get and manipulate data. If we want to utilize the built in methods for Arrays, we first must convert either the keys, values, or entries, into an array.
    * Object.keys(obj) will return an array of all the key values for a given object. This can then be further acted upon by built in Array methods.
    * Object.values(obj) will return an array of all enumerable property values of the object.
    * Object.entries(obj) will return an array of all key/value entries, with each key/value pair contained within their own array. [['key', 'value']]

#### Arrays are objects (?)
  * Arrays can be considered a special type of object. The typeof operator will return 'object' for arrays. 
  
#### Understand the concepts of pass-by-reference and pass-by-value
  * Primitive parameters (such as a number) are passed to functions by value; the value is passed to the function, but if the function changes the value of the parameter, this change is not reflected globally or in the calling function.
  * If you pass an object (i.e. a non-primitive value, such as Array or a user-defined object) as a parameter and the function changes the object's properties, that change is visible outside the function, as shown in the following example:
  * In essence, primitive values are considered pass by value, whereas objects and arrays are passed by reference.
  
#### Variables as pointers / references
  * We use the term pointers and references interchangeably in JavaScript.
  * Some variables will point/reference a place in memory that stores an Object/Array.
    * When declaring a variable, a memory address is assigned to that variable. Every time that code runs, a new variable will be created. JavaScript removes old and unused variables.
      * In the case of a primitive value, it can be thought of that the value itself is located at that memory address. That is to say, we follow 1 reference/pointer to get the value of the primitive value.
      * When dealing with objects, the variable is assigned a memory address, which in turn has a value, which is another memory address _instead_ of the value. Located at the second memory address, is finally the value of the object.
  * FOR THE TEST: VARIABLES ARE A NAME FOR ONE OF TWO THINGS, A PRIMITIVE VALUE, OR A POINTER/REFERENCE TO AN OBJECT.
  
#### Console.log vs return
  * Console.log is used to print something to the console. Return is used to pass values throughout the program. 
  
#### Truthiness vs. boolean
  * There are the primitive data type of boolean, which is either 'true' or 'false', and then there are values that are either 'truthy values' or 'falsy values' I.E. a value that javascript considers true or false in terms of conditionals.
  * All values in JavaScript are truthy values, except for:
    * (false)
    * null
    * undefined
    * 0
    * -0
    * 0n (0 big int)
    * NaN
    * '' or ""
  
#### Function definition and invocation
  * Before a function can be used, it must be defined. 
  * Function invocation, is the act of calling the function after it's been defined. (There may be some semantically differences between calling a function and invoking a function (direct vs indirect) but I doubt I need to be aware of that for the assessment)
  * Three ways to define a function are below

#### Function declarations, function expressions, and arrow functions
  * Function Declaration:
    ```javascript
    function functionName(zeroOrMoreArguments) {
      // You can call function declarations before you declare
      // them, due to hoisting
    }
    ```
    * Any function definition that doesn't have 'function' at the start, is a function expression! even:
      ```javascript
      (function functionName() {
        //this is a function expression NOT a function declaration
      });
      ```
  * Function Expressions:
    ```javascript
    let functionName = function(zeroOrMoreArguments) {
      // Function Expressions are NOT hoisted
      // and cannot be used before being defined
    }
    ``` 
    * Functions that take functions as an argument, or return functions, are called higher order functions. The function being returned is a function expression.
      ```javascript
      function functionDeclaration(arg) {
        return function functionExpression() {
          console.log(arg);
        };
      }
      ```
  * Arrow Functions:
    ```javascript
    let greetPeople = () => console.log("Good Morning!");
    ```
    * Arrow functions are similar to function expressions with two main differences:
      * Syntax
      * Implicit returns:
        * When the function body contains only a single expression (sub-expressions are allowed, but it must evaluate into one value)
          * Remember, in general, expressions are pieces of code that evaluate to a value.
  * Notes: For Test, do we need to know about anonymous functions?
    * 'The variable the function expression is assigned to will have a name property. The name doesn't change if it's assigned to a different variable. If function name is omitted, it will be the variable name (implicit name). If function name is present, it will be the function name (explicit name). This also applies to arrow functions (arrows don't have a name so you can only give the variable an implicit name).'

#### Implicit return value of function invocations
  * All functions will return undefined, regardless of if the return statement is used. Whether or not the program even uses the return value of a function is a different matter entirely.
  * Arrow functions implicitly return functions with only one expression.
  * Functions either return a value, or have a side effect. (Or both)
  
#### First-class functions
  * In JavaScript, all functions are first class functions, this means that functions can be treated just like any other variable, they can be passed to other functions, they can be returned from other functions.
    * If the function is being passed in as an argument, it's called a 'callback function'.
  * Functions that take other functions as arguments OR/AND return other functions, are called 'Higher-Order Functions'

#### Side-effects
  * Side effects are anything that happens by a function other than returning a value. 
  * A Side Effect changes the state of the program outside of the function.
    * A list of potential Side Effects:
      * Modifying any external variable or object property (e.g., a global variable, or a variable in the parent function scope chain)
      * Logging to the console
      * Writing to the screen
      * Writing to a file
      * Writing to the network
      * Triggering any external process
      * Calling any other functions with side-effects

#### Naming conventions (legal vs idiomatic)
  * A legal name is any name that JavaScript will accept as a valid name.
  * An idiomatic name, is a name that follows JavaScript standard naming practices.
    * Idiomatic naming practices:
      * camelCase
        * variables
        * functions
      * snake_case
      * SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE
        * constants

#### Be able to explain what a function does without talking about its implementation; that is, document a function's use and purpose.
